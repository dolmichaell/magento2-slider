# magento2-slider

I created magento2 Theme for test task

For reviewing you have to go to root magento2 directory and add folder "Slider" with all childs to folder: app/design/frontend.

Then from root directory start command: 
	
	bin/magento setup:upgrade

After that go to admin panel and choose my theme Test for global website in content -> configuration

Clear magento cache:
	
	 bin/magento c:c

Also please add few products, to make slick visible on desktop versions in magento2 admin page. 

Check view on Home page.
